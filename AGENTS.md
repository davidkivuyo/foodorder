# AGENTS.md

## Project Overview

Build a Flutter mobile application for university students to order food from the campus cafeteria.

The purpose of the application is to:

* Reduce cafeteria queues.
* Allow students to see available meals before arriving.
* Allow students to place food orders in advance.
* Help cafeteria staff manage orders efficiently.
* Minimize food waste caused by abandoned orders.

This application will eventually use Firebase for authentication and data storage, but Firebase must not be implemented until its phase is activated.

* View order history
* Account management

Cafe Admin Features

* Mark orders as collected

Order Management

* Order status tracking
* Collection confirmation

# Application Navigation

Bottom Navigation Bar must contain:

1. Home
2. Categories
3. Search
3. Orders
4. Account

This navigation structure should remain consistent throughout development.

# Agent Development Rules

## Rule 1

Implement only the active phase.

Do not implement future phases.

---

## Rule 2

Before writing code, answer:

1. Current phase?
2. Requirement being implemented?
3. Files being modified?
4. Possible regressions?

Then proceed.

---

## Rule 3

Use simple Flutter architecture.

Preferred structure:

lib/
├── screens/
├── widgets/
├── models/
├── services/
├── navigation/

Avoid unnecessary complexity.

Do not introduce advanced architecture unless requested.

---

## Rule 4

Preserve working functionality.

Never rewrite entire screens when small modifications are sufficient.

---

## Rule 5

After completing a feature:

* Verify build succeeds.
* Verify navigation works.
* Verify existing features still work.

---

# Current Phase

PHASE 1

Goal:

add the user information to firestore database upon registration in a document collection of users/{uid}. the data are kept in fields of fullName, email, role and createdAt. And display firstname and email it on the account page when logged in.

Requirements:

* the user data are kept in fields of fullName, email, role and createdAt.

Restrictions:

* Do not change anything not related to the task in the goal and requirements
* No cafe admin functionality

---

# Phase Completion Criteria

Phase 1 is complete when:

* App runs successfully.
* No runtime errors occur.
