# AGENTS.md

## Project Overview

Build a Flutter mobile application for university students to order food from the campus cafeteria.

The purpose of the application is to:

* Reduce cafeteria queues.
* Allow students to see available meals before arriving.
* Allow students to place food orders in advance.
* Help cafeteria staff manage orders efficiently.
* Minimize food waste caused by abandoned orders.

This application will eventually use Firebase for authentication and data storage, but Firebase must not be implemented until its phase is activated.

# Product Vision (Future Features)

The completed system may include:

Student Features

* Registration
* Login
* Browse daily menu
* Categories
* Place orders
* View order history
* Account management

Cafe Admin Features

* Registration
* Login
* Add food items
* Edit food items
* Remove food items
* Manage orders
* Mark orders as collected

Order Management

* Order status tracking
* Collection confirmation
* Prevention of abandoned orders

Backend

* Firebase Authentication
* Cloud Firestore
* Firebase Storage
* firebase notifications

These features are future phases and must not be implemented unless activated.

# Application Navigation

Bottom Navigation Bar must contain:

1. Home
2. Categories
3. Search
3. Orders
4. Account

This navigation structure should remain consistent throughout development.

# Agent Development Rules

## Rule 1

Implement only the active phase.

Do not implement future phases.

---

## Rule 2

Before writing code, answer:

1. Current phase?
2. Requirement being implemented?
3. Files being modified?
4. Possible regressions?

Then proceed.

---

## Rule 3

Use simple Flutter architecture.

Preferred structure:

lib/
├── data/
├── screens/
├── widgets/
├── models/
├── services/
├── navigation/

Avoid unnecessary complexity.

Do not introduce advanced architecture unless requested.

---

## Rule 4

Preserve working functionality.

Never rewrite entire screens when small modifications are sufficient.

---

## Rule 5

After completing a feature:

* Verify build succeeds.
* Verify navigation works.
* Verify all features still work.

---

# Current Phase

PHASE 1

Goal:

For offcampus labeled food items the users will only be allowed to call the associated cafe phone number instead of placing an order when added to cart, thus preventing the user from placing an order for offcampus food items. This will also add another field on the food item model to indicate the location of the offcampus cafes.

Requirements:

* Add a new field to the food item model to indicate the location of the offcampus cafes.
* When a user adds an offcampus food item to the cart, instead of allowing them to place an order, display a message prompting them to call the associated cafe phone number.

Restrictions:

* Do not change anything not related to the task in the goal and requirements
* No cafe admin functionality

---

# Phase Completion Criteria

Phase 1 is complete when:

* App runs successfully.
* No runtime errors occur.
